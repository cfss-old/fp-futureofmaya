# Final project

THis project was really rough- but we did work really hard on it, and hope we have demonstrated that we have in fact grown.

The final project is the markdown file called "finalfinalginalforevermarkdown", and the website, which can be found [here:](https://ritabiagioli.shinyapps.io/finalproject2/).

We know we have been a lot of work. We appreciate your efforts to help us, and hope you know that the trouble we caused was not out of a desire to be difficult, but a desire to understand.

Thanks

Rita and Carly
